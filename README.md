A banking app made only by myself. The concept is quite basic, I used Glade and SQLite3 besides C for the GUI and for the data. Although the code is quite rudimentary and repetitve,
I have learned a lot about the structure of making an app from the base and how to write code in a better way.
A detailed documentation can be found in the files. The project hasn't been finished but it set the ground for my next project, although I will most likely change the programming language.
